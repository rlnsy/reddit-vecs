# Content-Based Community Discovery and Recommendation on Reddit

## Origins
Seeing how many newsfeed and content-suggestion systems work nowadays, I was inspired to use machine learning to construct models for discovering new sources for news, entertainment etc.

## Why Reddit?
Reddit has for a long time been my go-to platform for aggregated web content. Recently, in an effort to break free of the closed circle of communities (subreddits) I had found myself in, I started to make new accounts just so I could go through the process of re-subscribing to new subs that I thought might be interesting. One of my hopes for this project is to automate and enhance this process by training a content-based recommendation system (that hopefully incorporates an element of deviation from current sources)

## Contribution
Right now this repo is mostly me just tinkering around from time to time, but feel free to contribute or give feedback!
